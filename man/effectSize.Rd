\usage{
effectSize(x, g)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An atomic vector of numeric data}

\item{g}{An atomic vector of strings or factors (categorical data)}
}
\value{
a numeric value for effect-size or Cohen's d
}
\description{
One very useful measure of effect size is Cohenâ€™s d. This is the difference in means between two groups divided by some measure of the standard deviation. Effect sizes are one of the most common parameters used in power analysis.
